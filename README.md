# How to test smart contracts on SmartPy

## Overview of the Tutorial
- I will be guiding the readers in a begginer level yet deep understanding guide in Tezos Smart Contract testing using SmartPy IDE.
- I am writing this tutorial because I faced a lot of issues while first learning about Smart Contracts on the Tezos Blockchain. I am a Tezos India Fellowship 2.0 Fellow and curently working on my project CryptoWill
- I will be guiding the readers along in the following topics:
  1.Initial Balance in testing a contract
  2.Test Accounts
  3.Calling Entrypoints
  4.Calling entrypoints with various parameters like sender , source , now , level , valid
  5.How to organise the scenario HTML Output using smartpy
  6.Accessing Contract parameters
- They will dive into the concept of testing and debugginf their contract to the fullest before deploying.
